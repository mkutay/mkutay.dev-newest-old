**procrastination** (noun): *The act or habit of procrastinating; a putting off to a future time; delay; dilatoriness.* (The Century Dictionary)


We all say that procrastination is a bad thing and that we should avoid it at all costs. I agree that procrastination disallows us to do what we actually must do, which are writing essays, doing homework, finishing projects, etc. Today, however, I want to give a new perspective on procrastination and why it might be useful sometimes.

For a long time, procrastination has been putting off some big and important projects by doing a small and less important project for me. This has allowed me to do a lot of things, from writing less important essays where the deadline is much further into the future to actually creating this website (and writing this post, OMEGALUL). And, for the last three weeks or so, I have been procrastinating writing my TOK essay by actually finishing my maths extended essay (38 pages to be exact)—you can probably imagine how stressed I am about writing the TOK essay that I am writing a fucking paper on MATHS. I mean, honestly, writing on maths is great and I really enjoyed writing it, so that's good. Moreover, the **horror** of the TOK essay allowed me to do some stuff that is actually productive.

I think _sometimes_ procrastinating might allow you to do stuff that you enjoy or stuff that you should do, but you do not need to rush. Yeah, that is all for today.

This has been a little bit on the short side of my latest posts. I just did not know what to write about (because this blog is a way for me to actually _procrastinate_).
